	<p>After a few weeks of quarantine, my family and I decided to visit the beach.</p>
<img src="/eliphotos/beach.jpg" alt="Beach">
	<p>Maybe the beach is empty because of the virus...or it may have just been because it was a chilly day.</p>
<img src="/eliphotos/birds.jpg" alt="Birds">
	<p>I am not 100% sure what these birds are but I think they are American Oyster Catchers.</p>
<img src="/eliphotos/family.jpg" alt="Family">
	<p>Heres my family after realizing it was a shitty day to go to the beach :D. Lets make the most of it shall we?</p>
<img src="/eliphotos/old.jpg" alt="OldHouse">
	<p>One of my favorite things to do in NYC is look at old houses...this one looks like its been through a lot.</p>

	<p>Speaking of old houses, heres my neighborhood from the 1940s! I spent a whole day of quarantine looking through the huge archive of old tax photos at the NYC Municipal Archives Collections website.</p>

	<p>Here is another way my family and I stayed busy during the quarantine. My grandma is the champ!:D</p>
<img src="/eliphotos/police.jpg" alt="PoliceCar">
	<p>Looks like Mad Max out here!</p>
<img src="/eliphotos/stores.jpg" alt="Stores">
	<p>With all the stores closed the city seems very surreal.</p>
<img src="/eliphotos/wendys.jpg" alt="Wendys">
	<p>Even the fastfood restaraunts are empty!</p>
<img src="/eliphotos/raccoon.jpg" alt="Raccoon" 
	<p>One of the only good things about this epidemic is that, due to less humans being outside, wildlife is invading the city! This little guy was very friendly and didnt run away from me</p>
<img src="/eliphotos/trees.jpg" alt="Trees">
	<p>Is it just me or are the trees even more beautiful during this time?</p>
